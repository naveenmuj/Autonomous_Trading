|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV)** | Raw price and volume data for each bar.                                 | -                                 |

| **Volatility**         | Standard deviation of returns over a window.                                | pandas.rolling.std                |
| **SMA (Simple Moving Average)** | Average of closing prices over N periods.                                 | SMA(df['close'], N)               |
| **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** | Weighted average of closing prices, more weight to recent prices.         | EMA(df['close'], N)               |
| **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** | Measures momentum, identifies overbought/oversold.                        | RSI(df['close'], 14)              |
| **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** | Trend-following momentum indicator.                                      | MACD(df['close'])                 |
| **Bollinger Bands**    | Volatility bands above/below SMA.                                           | BBANDS(df['close'])               |
| **Candlestick Patterns** | Pattern recognition for price action (see below for full list).             | TA-Lib CDL* functions             |
