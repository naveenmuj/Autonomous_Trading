# AI Trading Model: Learned Features and Decision Logic

## Overview
This document describes the features and logic that your AI trading models will now learn and use for decision making. The models are trained on historical data that includes both raw price/volume information and engineered features such as candlestick patterns and technical indicators.

---

## 1. Raw Market Data
- **Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV):**
  - The basic price and volume data for each time interval (e.g., daily, hourly).
  - Example:
    - Open: 2500.0
    - High: 2550.0
    - Low: 2490.0
    - Close: 2540.0
    - Volume: 1,200,000

---

## 2. Candlestick Pattern Recognition
- **Pattern Column:**
  - Detected by TA-Lib and custom logic in your DataCollector.
  - Encodes the most significant candlestick pattern for each bar (e.g., Bullish Engulfing, Doji, Hammer, etc.).
  - Used as a categorical feature for the model to learn the predictive value of each pattern.

---

## 3. Technical Indicators
- **Moving Averages (SMA, EMA):**
  - 10, 20, 50 period averages of closing price.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):**
  - Measures momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
- **MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.**
  - Additional indicators can be added as features.

## 4. Engineered Features
- **Returns:**
  - Percentage change in price over various periods.
- **Volatility:**
  - Standard deviation of returns over a window.
- **Other Custom Features:**
  - Any additional features you add to the DataCollector or feature engineering pipeline.

---

## 5. How the Model Learns
- The model receives all the above features as input.
- It learns statistical relationships between these features and the target (e.g., future price movement, buy/sell signal).
- The model does not "understand" trading concepts, but it learns which patterns, indicators, and price behaviors are historically predictive of profitable trades.

## 6. Example Feature Table
| Open  | High  | Low   | Close | Volume   | Pattern           | SMA_10 | RSI  | ... |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|------|-----|
| 2500  | 2550  | 2490  | 2540  | 1200000  | Bullish Engulfing | 2520   | 65   | ... |
| 2540  | 2560  | 2530  | 2555  | 1100000  | Doji              | 2530   | 68   | ... |

---

## 7. Decision Making
- After training, the model uses these features to make predictions on new data.
- Example: If a Bullish Engulfing pattern appears with high RSI and above-average volume, the model may learn this is a good buy signal (if historically profitable).

---

## 8. Extensibility
- You can add more features (e.g., news sentiment, order book data) to further enhance the modelâ€™s learning.
- The model will automatically learn from any new features included in the training data.
